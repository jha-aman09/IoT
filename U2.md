## **Hardware for IoT**

---

### **1. Sensors:**

* Devices that **detect physical parameters** like temperature, humidity, light, motion, etc.
* Provide **real-world input** to IoT systems.

### **2. Digital Sensors:**

* Output is in **digital format (1s and 0s)**.
* Examples: **DHT11 (temperature/humidity), PIR (motion), ultrasonic sensors**.
* Easier to integrate with microcontrollers due to no analog-to-digital conversion needed.

### **3. Actuators:**

* **Devices that perform actions** based on sensor inputs or commands.
* Convert electrical signals into **mechanical motion**.
* Examples: **Motors, servos, solenoids, buzzers, relays**.

### **4. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):**

* Uses **electromagnetic fields** to identify and track objects wirelessly.
* Components:

  * **RFID Tags:** Attached to objects (active or passive).
  * **RFID Reader:** Scans tags and transmits data.
* Used in **asset tracking, access control, inventory management**.

### **5. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN):**

* Networks of **spatially distributed sensors** connected wirelessly.
* Collect and transmit data cooperatively to a central hub or cloud.
* Protocols: **Zigbee, LoRa, 6LoWPAN**.
* Used in **agriculture, environmental monitoring, military**.

### **6. Participatory Sensing Technology:**

* Involves **human participation** using personal devices (like smartphones) to gather and share sensor data.
* Examples:

  * **Crowdsourced traffic or pollution monitoring**
  * **Fitness apps tracking steps or heart rate**
* Leverages the **ubiquity of mobile devices** for large-scale sensing.

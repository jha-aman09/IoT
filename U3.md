## **Network & Communication Aspects in IoT**

---

### **1. Wireless Medium Access Issues:**

* **Challenge:** Multiple devices sharing the same wireless medium can cause **collisions, delays, and energy loss**.
* Issues:

  * **Contention:** Devices competing for bandwidth.
  * **Interference:** Overlapping frequencies affect communication.
  * **Power Constraints:** Nodes must conserve energy during transmission.

---

### **2. MAC Protocol Survey:**

* **MAC (Medium Access Control)** protocols manage how nodes access the wireless medium.
* Common protocols:

  * **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access):** Allocates time slots, energy-efficient.
  * **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance):** Used in Wi-Fi.
  * **S-MAC, T-MAC:** Designed for energy-saving in sensor networks.
* Goal: **Balance energy efficiency, latency, and reliability.**

---

### **3. Survey of Routing Protocols:**

* Define how data is **routed from nodes to gateways/cloud**.
* Types:

  * **Flat Routing:** All nodes are equal (e.g., Flooding, Gossiping).
  * **Hierarchical Routing:** Cluster-based (e.g., LEACH).
  * **Location-Based Routing:** Uses GPS or node position (e.g., GPSR).
* Focus: **Scalability, low energy use, reliability.**

---

### **4. Sensor Deployment & Node Discovery:**

* **Sensor Deployment:** Strategic placement of nodes to ensure coverage and connectivity.

  * Methods: **Deterministic** (planned) or **Random** (e.g., aerial drop in forests).
* **Node Discovery:** Mechanism for nodes to find neighbors and configure themselves.

  * Uses **HELLO messages, beacon signals**, etc.

## **Data Aggregation & Dissemination**

---

### **1. Data Aggregation:**

* Combines data from multiple nodes to **reduce redundancy and communication cost**.
* Techniques: **Average, min/max, fusion, compression**.
* Reduces **energy consumption and improves network life**.

### **2. Data Dissemination:**

* Distributing data (like software updates or commands) to sensor nodes.
* Methods:

  * **Flooding**
  * **Directed Diffusion**
  * **Multicasting**
* Goal: **Efficient delivery with minimal overhead**.

## **Programming the Arduino for IoT**

---

### **1. Arduino Platform Boards Anatomy:**

* Components:

  * **Microcontroller:** Main processor (e.g., ATmega328)
  * **I/O Pins:** For sensors/actuators (Digital/Analog)
  * **Power Supply, Clock, Reset, USB Interface**
* Popular Boards: **Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega, Leonardo**

---

### **2. Arduino IDE:**

* **Integrated Development Environment** for writing, compiling, and uploading code.
* Features:

  * Serial monitor, library manager, board selector.
  * Compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux.

---

### **3. Coding Using Emulator:**

* **Simulators/Emulators:** Help test Arduino code without hardware.
* Examples: **Tinkercad, Proteus, Wokwi**
* Useful for **debugging circuits, learning, and remote development**.

---

### **4. Using Libraries:**

* Libraries provide **pre-written code** for common hardware and tasks.
* Examples:

  * `DHT.h` for temperature/humidity sensors
  * `WiFi.h` for network functions
  * `LiquidCrystal.h` for LCD displays

---

### **5. Additions in Arduino:**

* Add-ons for IoT development:

  * **Wi-Fi Modules (ESP8266, ESP32)**
  * **Bluetooth Modules (HC-05/HC-06)**
  * **LoRa Shields, GSM Modules**
* Extend Arduino capabilities for **networking and remote control**.

### **6. Programming the Arduino for IoT:**

* **Basic Flow:**

  * Connect sensor → Read data → Process → Send to cloud or perform action.
* Sample Tasks:

  * Send temperature data to Thingspeak.
  * Turn on LED via mobile app (Blynk or MQTT).
* Involves:

  * **Analog/Digital I/O**
  * **Serial/UART Communication**
  * **Wi-Fi/HTTP/MQTT protocols**
  * **APIs and JSON handling**
